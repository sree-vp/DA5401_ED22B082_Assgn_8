**Submission details**
- A single file named DA_Lab_8_ED22B082 contains all the code and explanation.
- Two different approaches are tried - one using time series and one using random split. Both are presented consecutively with markdowns.

**Brief on Assignment**  
This assignment focuses on implementing and comparing three primary Ensemble Learning techniques: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking on a bike-sharing demand regression problem. The core objective is to demonstrate how these methods effectively manage the bias-variance trade-off to achieve superior predictive accuracy (lowest RMSE) compared to single baseline models.
